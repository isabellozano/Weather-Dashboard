# Weather-Dashboard


Hello to whoever decides to read this and checks out my nonexistent Weather Dashboard!

So this project solely exists to help me better understand and better use server-side API's courtesy of the coding program I'm in.

Boy oh boy did I fail big time though because the API is nonexistent in my code just as much as my code is Casper the friendly ghost and not real.

It's currently failing tremendously as I wasn't able to implement the API's properly or code anything out beyond psuedocoding what I would do.
